# Welcome to the Weather App

This project was created with React and TypeScript.

## Getting started

To run this app, follow the steps below:

1. Using the green `<> Code` button, copy the link and git clone the app on your local machine
2. If you don't have `Node.js` installed on your machine, visit this link to download it: https://nodejs.org/en/download
3. Visit https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/weather to sign up for an API key - you will need to subscribe to the Current Weather and 16 Day Forecast endpoints using the free subscription
4. Navigate to the weather-app directory and run npm install - this should install all of the necessary dependencies, such as axios
5. Edit the `apiFunctions.ts` file (this can be found in src -> apiFunctions) and paste the API key into `X-RapidAPI-Key`
6. You can now use `npm start` to run the application
